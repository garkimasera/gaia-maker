concept = "In Gaia Maker, players assume the role of overseer of an undeveloped planet and the star system that contains it, and are responsible for terraforming and operating the facility. Terraforming is the process of improving a barren planet into a habitable environment. Terraforming is essential for humans to establish large settlements outside of Earth. Various types of facilities are constructed to adjust the atmosphere, temperature, and vegetation on the planet. In this way, we can create an ideal environment for life."
player = "The player, the overseer, has come a long way over the years in an interstellar spacecraft to this star system containing a terraforming candidate planet. The overseer possesses technology equivalent to a Type II civilization and also possesses terraforming technology for an Earth-like planet. They have also brought genetic data of various plants and animals from their home planet for terraforming.\n\nType II civilization refers to civilization that has a technological level capable of utilizing all the energy in a star system, according to the Kardashev scale. They collect energy from stars using Dyson Swarms, and use the abundant energy for interstellar travel and terraforming."
terraforming = "The basis of terraforming is to control the temperature, precipitation, and soil on the planet to allow plants to grow. The following facilities can help with this.\n\nOrbital Mirror\nThis facility, which can be built in planetary orbits, increases or decreases the amount of stellar light reaching the surface and alter the temperature.\n\nRainmaker\nIf the planet has an ocean, there will be rainfall around it, otherwise this facility will generate rainfall.\n\nSoil Fertilization Plant\nIncreases the fertility of the surrounding area and grows plants."

oxygen-generator = "Oxygen Generators isolate oxygen from oxides in the planet's crust. The process requires a large amount of power."
rainmaker = "Rainmakers generate rain clouds and increase the amount of rainfall in the surrounding area."
fertilization-plant = "Soil Fertilization Plants slowly transform the surrounding area into soil suitable for plant growth. Plant growth requires soil with sufficient nutrients, and Soil Fertilization Plant promotes their formation by deploying fertilizers and soil improvement drones."
heater = "Heaters emit energy into the atmosphere as heat, raising the surrounding temperature."
carbon-capturer = "Carbon Capturers collect and reduce carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The carbon obtained through reduction is stored underground, and the oxygen is released into the atmosphere."
gift-tower = "Gift Towers supply energy to the surrounding civilization. They provide energy in the most convenient form according to the technological level of that civilization. They promote the growth of civilization, but energy obtained without effort can also have a negative impact on civilization."

fusion-reactor = "Fusion Reactors provide the power needed to operate facilities. Fusion is a highly efficient energy source essential to space civilization, but if more energy is needed, it will require the use of giant fusion reactors, stars."
asteroid-mining-station = "Asteroid Mining Stations mine ore from asteroids and process it into materials that can be used for construction and other purposes."
dyson-swarm-unit = "The Dyson Swarm is one form of the Dyson Sphere, a megastructure designed to harness the full energy emitted by a star. Each unit is merely a giant mirror that reflects light and delivers it to the demand location, but in sufficient numbers, they provide enough energy for terraforming."
orbital-mirror = "Orbital Mirror reflects the stellar light and increases or decreases the amount of light energy that reaches the surface of the planet. The ratio can be adjusted."
ice-importer = "Ice Importers transport ice from other celestial bodies within the star system. They increase the amount of water on the planet. Extracting and transporting ice requires a large amount of power."
nitrogen-importer = "Nitrogen Importers transport nitrogen from other celestial bodies in the star system that have ammonia in their atmosphere, and spray it into the planet's atmosphere. Extracting and transporting nitrogen requires a large amount of power."
carbon-importer = "Carbon Importers transport carbon from other celestial bodies in the star system, and spray it into the planet's atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Extracting and transporting carbon requires a large amount of power."
ion-irradiator = "Ion Irradiators collide accelerated ions with the planet's atmosphere, which bounce the molecules off into space. The effect is to reduce atmospheric pressure by reducing the mass of the planet's atmosphere."

aerosol-injection = "Aerosols are injected into the atmosphere of the planet. This promotes cloud formation, and in many cases, the planet begins to reflect more light from the star, causing the temperature to drop. The effect of this decreases over time."
black-dust = "Black dust is spread over the surface of the planet. The surface of the planet absorbs more of the stellar light, causing the temperature of the surrounding area to rise. This dust disappears over time."
fire = "It will cause a fire in the specified tile. It will burn the biomass on the ground, destroying civilization and animals. It will increase carbon dioxide and aerosols."
plague = "The plague will spread to the city you have selected. The plague will also infect other cities over time, reducing the population of civilization."
vehicle = "Advanced civilizations use ships and airplanes for travel."
decadence = "Civilizations that have achieved a certain level of prosperity may become decadent. In a decadent civilization, people neglect maintaining the foundations of prosperity - science, technology, culture, and infrastructure - or actively damage these foundations. The population and level of technology in the civilization decline."

ocean = "Oceans are bodies of water with a certain area and depth. They are an important source of water for the planet, and marine life can live in them."
sea-ice = "Sea ice is an area where the sea surface has frozen due to the low temperature."
grassland = "Grasslands are fertile areas where grasslands spread out. If there is not enough rainfall for forests to develop, they become grasslands. There are fewer organisms in grasslands than in forests."
tundra = "A tundra is an area where permafrost exists underground. Because it is cold, forests do not develop, but there is a small amount of life."

tropical-rainforest = "Tropical rainforests are forests that form in regions that are even warmer and wetter than temperate forests. Many forms of life exist here."

oxygen = "Oxygen is essential for life to exist. An ideal level would be 20% in the atmosphere, and too little or too much would be a problem."
nitrogen = "Nitrogen is essential for keeping atmospheric pressure. In addition, nitrogen is one of the essential components of life, and some of the nitrogen in the atmosphere is absorbed by living organisms."
carbon-dioxide = "Carbon Dioxide is essential for plant growth. It also plays a role in regulating the temperature of the planet through its greenhouse effect. Too little can cause cooling, while too much can cause warming. For this reason, changes in its concentration have a significant impact on the environment of the entire planet."
argon = "Argon does not react with other chemicals, so its concentration does not change much. It contributes slightly to keeping atmospheric pressure."

biomass = "Biomass is the amount of living organisms in a particular area or on a planet as a whole, expressed in terms of the mass of carbon. When plants grow, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is stored in their bodies as carbon. In contrast, when the biomass of an area decreases due to factors such as fire, the carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere. The more biomass there is in an area, the easier it is for animals to breed there."
civilization = "Animals with a certain level of intelligence and a body size suitable for using tools can be made intelligent through genetic manipulation and given civilization. From the player's perspective, they will build a primitive civilization, because that civilization cannot leave the planet. The civilization will start with stone age technology, and over time will acquire more advanced technology. The existence of an expanded civilization will also have an impact on the planet's environment."
cloud-albedo = "Cloud albedo represents the proportion of stellar light reflected by clouds."
fertility = "Fertility refers to the fertility of the soil on land, or the nutrient content of the seawater in the ocean. If the land is fertile, forests will grow and it will be easier for a civilization to flourish. In order for the land to become fertile, it is necessary to have the right temperature and rainfall."

This means that they are already obtaining enough energy to sustain their civilization without having to exploit natural resources. In addition, the surplus energy is enough to escape from the planet's gravity."

[help.energy_source]
biomass = "Biomass is energy obtained by burning things like firewood and animal fat, or by making livestock work. It can be used regardless of the level of technology in a civilization, but because it directly consumes biomass from the natural world, if a civilization consumes a lot of energy, relying on biomass can cause significant environmental destruction. As technology advances and other forms of energy become available, consumption will decrease."
solar-wind = "Solar and wind energy use stellar light and wind as their energy source. Because of their low energy density, a large area is needed to obtain a large amount of energy, and land acquisition can cause environmental destruction. Also, because of their instability, the efficiency of this energy source decreases as the proportion of this energy source increases. However, in the case of civilizations with advanced technology, if they are used as supplementary energy sources, they can be a highly efficient energy source."
hydro-geothermal = "Hydropower and geothermal energy extract energy from the flow of rivers and geothermal heat. They are important as highly efficient energy sources for industrialized civilizations. However, the amount that can be used is limited. They also cause some environmental destruction."
fossil-fuel = "Fossil fuels extract energy by burning carbon buried in the ground. They are an important energy source for industrialized civilizations. In order to use them, the civilization must have access to land where the carbon is buried, and in some cases they may not be available on certain planets. In addition, when a civilization consumes fossil fuels, carbon dioxide is emitted. They also cause a small amount of environmental destruction in terms of mining and consumption."
nuclear = "Nuclear energy is the energy obtained from nuclear fission of uranium and thorium, or nuclear fusion of deuterium. It is the most efficient energy source that intelligent life on a planet can obtain, and it has almost no impact on the environment. Although it is an ideal energy source from a physical perspective, it is necessary to maintain a high level of technology in order to use it. It should also be remembered that civilizations that can use nuclear energy also have the technology to carry out nuclear war."
gift = "Gift energy is energy that the overseer makes available to primitive civilizations on the planet. It is supplied in the form that is easiest for them to use, depending on the level of technology in a civilization. It is highly efficient energy that primitive civilizations would not normally be able to obtain, and so it will have a significant impact on the evolution of civilization."
