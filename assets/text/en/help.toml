concept = "In Gaia Maker, players assume the role of overseer of an undeveloped planet and the star system that contains it, and are responsible for terraforming and operating the facility. Terraforming is the process of improving a barren planet into a habitable environment. Terraforming is essential for humans to establish large settlements outside of Earth. Various types of facilities are constructed to adjust the atmosphere, temperature, and vegetation on the planet. In this way, we can create an ideal environment for life."
player = "The player, the overseer, has come a long way over the years in an interstellar spacecraft to this star system containing a terraforming candidate planet. The overseer possesses technology equivalent to a Type II civilization and also possesses terraforming technology for an Earth-like planet. They have also brought genetic data of various plants and animals from their home planet for terraforming.\n\nType II civilization refers to civilization that has a technological level capable of utilizing all the energy in a star system, according to the Kardashev scale. They collect energy from stars using Dyson Swarms, and use the abundant energy for interstellar travel and terraforming."
terraforming = "The basis of terraforming is to control the temperature, precipitation, and soil on the planet to allow plants to grow. The following facilities can help with this.\n\nOrbital Mirror\nThis facility, which can be built in planetary orbits, increases or decreases the amount of stellar light reaching the surface and alter the temperature.\n\nRainmaker\nIf the planet has an ocean, there will be rainfall around it, otherwise this facility will generate rainfall.\n\nSoil Fertilization Plant\nIncreases the fertility of the surrounding area and grows plants."

oxygen-generator = "Oxygen Generators isolate oxygen from oxides in the planet's crust. The process requires a large amount of power."
rainmaker = "Rainmakers generate rain clouds and increase the amount of rainfall in the surrounding area."
fertilization-plant = "Soil Fertilization Plants slowly transform the surrounding area into soil suitable for plant growth. Plant growth requires soil with sufficient nutrients, and Soil Fertilization Plant promotes their formation by deploying fertilizers and soil improvement drones."
heater = "Heaters emit energy into the atmosphere as heat, raising the surrounding temperature."
carbon-capturer = "Carbon Capturers collect and reduce carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The carbon obtained through reduction is stored underground, and the oxygen is released into the atmosphere."
gift-tower = "Gift Towers supply energy to the surrounding civilization. They provide energy in the most convenient form according to the technological level of that civilization. They promote the growth of civilization, but energy obtained without effort can also have a negative impact on civilization."

fusion-reactor = "Fusion Reactors provide the power needed to operate facilities. Fusion is a highly efficient energy source essential to space civilization, but if more energy is needed, it will require the use of giant fusion reactors, stars."
asteroid-mining-station = "Asteroid Mining Stations mine ore from asteroids and process it into materials that can be used for construction and other purposes."
dyson-swarm-unit = "The Dyson Swarm is one form of the Dyson Sphere, a megastructure designed to harness the full energy emitted by a star. Each unit is merely a giant mirror that reflects light and delivers it to the demand location, but in sufficient numbers, they provide enough energy for terraforming."
orbital-mirror = "Orbital Mirror reflects the stellar light and increases or decreases the amount of light energy that reaches the surface of the planet. The ratio can be adjusted."
ice-importer = "Ice Importers transport ice from other celestial bodies within the star system. They increase the amount of water on the planet. Extracting and transporting ice requires a large amount of power."
nitrogen-importer = "Nitrogen Importers transport nitrogen from other celestial bodies in the star system that have ammonia in their atmosphere, and spray it into the planet's atmosphere. Extracting and transporting nitrogen requires a large amount of power."
carbon-importer = "Carbon Importers transport carbon from other celestial bodies in the star system, and spray it into the planet's atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Extracting and transporting carbon requires a large amount of power."
ion-irradiator = "Ion Irradiators collide accelerated ions with the planet's atmosphere, which bounce the molecules off into space. The effect is to reduce atmospheric pressure by reducing the mass of the planet's atmosphere."

aerosol-injection = "Aerosols are injected into the atmosphere of the planet. This promotes cloud formation, and in many cases, the planet begins to reflect more light from the star, causing the temperature to drop. The effect of this decreases over time."
black-dust = "Black dust is spread over the surface of the planet. The surface of the planet absorbs more of the stellar light, causing the temperature of the surrounding area to rise. This dust disappears over time."
fire = "It will cause a fire in the specified tile. It will burn the biomass on the ground, destroying civilization and animals. It will increase carbon dioxide and aerosols."
plague = "The plague will spread to the city you have selected. The plague will also infect other cities over time, reducing the population of civilization."
vehicle = "Advanced civilizations use ships and airplanes for travel."
war = "Cities can become involved in wars. The population of cities during wars decreases."
