[tutorial]
start-0 = "After a long journey, you have arrived at a planet suitable for terraforming. Become the overseer of this planet and transform it into an environment suitable for life through terraforming."
start-1-1 = "To move your viewpoint on the planet, use the WASD or arrow keys."
start-1-2 = "You can move the viewpoint to the tile under the cursor by middle-clicking the mouse, and zoom in/out with the mouse wheel."
start-1-3 = "Also, you can grasp the entire planet's state on the map in the bottom right of the screen. If the map is closed, click the following icon in the bottom right of the screen."

power-0-1 = "In order to operate facilities used for terraforming, sufficient power is required. Power consumption and production are shown at the top of the screen as follows."
power-0-2 = "Construction of facilities requires materials. Stored materials and production rates are shown at the top of the screen as follows."
power-1-1 = "To increase the production of power and materials, click on the following icon in the top left of the screen to open the building window and build Fusion Reactors and Asteroid Mining Stations."
power-1-2 = "Click the button labeled \"+1\" to build the specified buildings."
power-checklist1 = "Possess 5 or more Fusion Reactors."
power-checklist2 = "Possess 5 or more Asteroid Mining Stations."

fertilize-0-1 = "Once you have enough power, you can start greening the planet.\nPlants need land, moderate temperatures, and rainfall to grow. You can check the air temperature and rainfall of the tile under the cursor with the indicator in the top right of the screen, so please use that to find a tile that is suitable for plants. The air temperature and rainfall are represented by the following icons."
fertilize-0-2 = "The air temperature should be between 10 and 30°C, and the rainfall should be at least 500mm."
fertilize-1-1 = "When you find a tile with good conditions, click on the icon below in the toolbar to open the menu and select the Soil Fertilization Plant. Then, click on the target tile to build."
fertilize-1-2 = "Let's build several Soil Fertilization Plants at a distance from each other. When you've finished building, click the icon below on the toolbar to advance the time."
fertilize-1-3 = "As time passes, grasslands will spread out as in the example below. If grasslands don't form no matter how long you wait, check the temperature and rainfall again."
fertilize-checklist1 = "Build 3 or more Soil Fertilization Plants on the planet surface."
fertilize-checklist2 = "Spread grasslands over 10 or more tiles."

build-oxygen-0-1 = "Congratulations! Life has begun to spread across the planet. Next, let's check the state of the atmosphere. Click on the following icon in the bottom left of the screen to open the statistics window, and then click on the 'Atmosphere' tab."
build-oxygen-0-2 = "For advanced ecosystems such as forests and animals, a certain amount of oxygen is needed in the planet's atmosphere. If there is not enough oxygen, let's build Oxygen Generators."
build-oxygen-1-1 = "Oxygen Generators require a lot of power. Click on the following icon in the top left of the screen to open the building window and construct Dyson Swarm Units to obtain power."
build-oxygen-1-2 = "If you don't have enough materials for building, please advance the time after adding Asteroid Mining Stations.\nAfter obtaining power, open the menu by clicking the icon below in the toolbar, and select Oxygen Generator. Then, click on an empty tile to build it."
build-oxygen-checklist1 = "Possess 5 or more Dyson Swarm Units."
build-oxygen-checklist2 = "Build 8 or more Oxygen Generators on the planet surface."

wait-oxygen-0-1 = "Once you have built Oxygen Generators, the oxygen concentration will increase, and you will have to wait for forests to form. As fertile tiles grow plants, biomass increases, eventually turning into forests.\nThis process takes time, so click on the following icon in the toolbar to advance the time quickly."
wait-oxygen-0-2 = "If you want to speed up this process, add Dyson Swarm Units and Oxygen Generators as soon as you have enough materials."
wait-oxygen-checklist1 = "Reach an oxygen partial pressure of 0.12 atm."
wait-oxygen-checklist2 = "Spread forests over 50 or more tiles."

carbon-0-1 = "The atmosphere of this planet seems to have a little too much carbon dioxide. Plants will eventually absorb the carbon dioxide, but you can remove it more quickly using Carbon Capturers. The removed carbon is stored underground as buried carbon and will be used by civilizations in later eras as fossil fuels.\nOpen the menu by clicking the icon below in the toolbar, and select Carbon Capturer. Then, click on an empty tile to build it."
carbon-0-2 = "If you don't have enough power to build, you can add Dyson Swarm Units or remove Oxygen Generators. You can select \"Demolition\" from the same menu as building."
carbon-checklist1 = "Build 2 or more Carbon Capturers on the planet surface."

animal-0-1 = "If there are currently enough forests, then the conditions are right to introduce your favorite animals. You need gene points to spawn animals. The number of gene points you currently have is shown at the top of the screen as follows."
animal-0-2 = "Gene points gradually increase over time. The amount of increase becomes larger as the amount of life on the planet rises."
animal-1-1 = "To spawn animals, click on the following icon in the top left of the screen to display the animal window."
animal-1-2 = "Select your favorite animal from the animal list, press the “Spawn” button, and then click on a tile to place the animal. When placing animals, the tile you place them on should be an environment suitable for that animal. For example, a starfish needs to be placed in an ocean tiles. If placed in a suitable environment, the animal will reproduce on surrounding tiles over time. Additionally, animals may mutate into different species."
animal-checklist1 = "Have foxes inhabit more than 30 tiles."

civilize-0-1 = "Animals eventually evolve and develop civilization, but it is also possible to intentionally give them civilization through the process of being civilized. Click the following icon on the toolbar at the top of the screen to open the menu, and select \"Civilize\""
civilize-0-2 = "Then, by clicking on a tile inhabited by an animal, a city of civilized animals will appear."
civilize-checklist1 = "Establish a civilization city on the planet."

control-civ-0-1 = "It is possible to interfere with civilizations on the planet and change their direction. Click the following icon in the top left of the screen to display the control window, and click the 'Civilization' tab."
control-civ-0-2 = "For a trial, let's adjust the population growth slider to 150% or more. This will make it easier for the civilization's population to increase.\nYou can also adjust the frequency of wars and energy sources."
control-civ-checklist1 = "Adjust civilization population growth to 150% or more."

orbital-mirror-0-1 = "An Orbital Mirror is the best way to instantly and finely adjust the planet's temperature for the sake of life and civilization. click on the following icon in the top left of the screen to open the building window, then click the button labeled “+1” under the Orbital Mirror section to construct it."
orbital-mirror-0-2 = "The Orbital Mirror is a structure that directly regulates the stellar light. You can adjust it using the slider in the Orbital Mirror section.\nEven small changes in light intensity can have a significant impact on the planet, so start by moving the slider into the -10% to -5% range to lower the temperature slightly.\nAnd you can check how the average temperature and biomass of the entire planet have changed from the graph in the 'History' tab of the statistics window. The statistics window can be opened by clicking the following icon in the bottom left of the screen."
orbital-mirror-checklist1 = "Possess an Orbital Mirror."
orbital-mirror-checklist2 = "Adjust the Orbital Mirror to within the -10% to -5% range."

complete-0-1 = "Congratulations! You have improved the planet's environment enough for civilization to develop. You are free to continue improving the planet, watch over the animals and civilization, or destroy them. The tutorial is now over, but you can continue playing. If you want to start on another planet, select \"New\" from the main menu."
